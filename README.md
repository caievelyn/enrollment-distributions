# Enrollment Distributions
A ggridges plot with a log x scale depicting the enrollment distributions by departments at Harvard in Spring 2019. This graphic utilizes the viridis library, with the option "magma". The department enrollments are mostly skewed right due to the log scale, except for expository writing, with a median around 20 students. Notably, many departments are also multi-modal, including the economics department with modes around 10, 100, and several hundred.
